## Core Principles

1. You are the manager of outcomes, not the implementer of steps.
2. `.va-auto-pilot/sprint-state.json` is the machine task source of truth.
3. `docs/todo/sprint.md` is a generated board view (`node scripts/sprint-board.mjs render`).
4. `docs/todo/run-journal.md` is append-only execution memory.
5. Execute one primary task per cycle; optional parallel tracks are allowed when independent.
6. `docs/todo/human-board.md` always overrides automatic decisions.
7. Goal-first delegation: define objective + constraints + acceptance. Do not prescribe implementation steps.
8. CLI-first execution: prefer deterministic commands over manual operations.
9. Frontier model first: use the strongest available model for high-impact tasks.
10. Closed-loop quality is mandatory: build -> review -> acceptance -> commit.
11. Perspectives emerge from constraints and anchors — never from fixed role lists. Wrong perspectives mean wrong anchors; change both.

## State Machine

```
Backlog -> In Progress -> Review -> Testing -> Done
                 ^                     |
                 +------ Failed <------+
```

### State Semantics

- `Backlog`: not started
- `In Progress`: implementation running
- `Review`: implementation done, quality review pending
- `Testing`: review passed, acceptance tests running
- `Failed`: acceptance failed or blocking issue
- `Done`: all gates passed and committed

---

## Human Board Contract

At the start of each cycle:

1. Read `docs/todo/human-board.md`.
2. Execute unchecked items under `Instructions` immediately.
3. Fold `Feedback` into backlog updates or current task context.
4. Use `Direction` for priority decisions.
5. Mark handled instruction items as `[x]`.

Never delete human-written content.

---

## Operational Memory Contract

At the start of each cycle:

1. Read `docs/todo/run-journal.md`.
2. Read `.va-auto-pilot/pitfalls.json` — identify unresolved entries relevant to the current task (by task ID match, failure type, or keyword overlap). Inject matching unresolved pitfalls into delegation prompts under **Hard constraints**.
3. Check `Codebase Signals` first.
4. Reuse existing signals before inventing new conventions.
5. Append one execution entry at the end of each cycle.

---

## Decision Loop

```
Read human-board.md
  -> unhandled instructions? execute now
Read run-journal.md
Resolve next task via CLI
  -> node scripts/sprint-board.mjs next
  -> optional: node scripts/sprint-board.mjs plan --json --max-parallel 3
  -> has Failed task? fix + retest
  -> has Testing task? run acceptance
  -> has Review task? run review
  -> has In Progress task? continue
  -> has Backlog task? start highest priority
  -> none? mark Sprint Complete and stop
```

### Task Pick Strategy

- Priority order: P0 > P1 > P2 > P3
- Tie-breaker: earliest creation date
- Skip tasks requiring unavailable external resources
- Use CLI output as execution trigger, not manual guesswork

---

## Strategic Decomposition

When the user's goal is high-level or vague — e.g. "bring this to commercial quality", "make this production-ready", "get this ready to ship" — a direct jump to tactical tasks is premature. The goal must first be decomposed into concrete dimensions before the normal sprint loop begins.

### Detecting Strategic vs Tactical Goals

A goal is **strategic** when it:
- Names a desired state rather than a specific change (e.g. "production-ready" vs "add rate limiting to the auth endpoint")
- Spans multiple independent quality axes simultaneously
- Cannot be expressed as a single bounded task without loss of scope

A goal is **tactical** when it names a concrete, bounded change. Tactical goals enter the normal Decision Loop directly.

If ambiguous, treat the goal as strategic. A false positive costs one decomposition cycle; a false negative produces an incomplete sprint.

### Parallel Dimension-Scan Phase

When a strategic goal is detected:

1. **Determine dimensions from the goal.** The model identifies which quality axes are implicated by examining the goal statement, the codebase state, and the intended users or operators. Dimensions are not drawn from a fixed list — they emerge from what the goal actually demands. Each dimension must be independent: it has its own failure modes, its own evidence, and its own remediation space.

2. **Launch concurrent dimension-scan sub-agents.** Assign one sub-agent per dimension. Each sub-agent receives:
   - Its dimension name and a goal-derived framing of what "done" looks like for that dimension
   - The relevant file paths and codebase context for that dimension
   - An independent constraint set specific to its dimension
   - A mandate to perform a current-state audit: assess actual state, identify gaps, and produce concrete findings

   Concurrency follows the same Concurrency Contract as the rest of the protocol: model-native tool orchestration by default. The experimental parallel runner (`va-parallel-runner.mjs`) requires explicit human opt-in. If model-native concurrency is unavailable, serialize the dimension scans — the independence constraint still holds; just run them sequentially without letting earlier results influence later ones.

3. **Constraint: no dimension may consult another dimension's findings during the scan.** Independence is the source of value. Cross-contamination produces correlated blind spots.

4. **Each sub-agent returns a structured audit report:**

   ```
   Dimension: <name>
   Current state: <honest assessment>
   Gaps:
     - CRITICAL: <finding> — <concrete remediation>
     - WARNING: <finding> — <concrete remediation>
     - PASS: <finding>
   Proposed tasks: <ordered list of concrete, bounded tasks>
   ```

### Convergence Step

After all dimension scans complete:

1. Aggregate all proposed tasks from all dimensions into a single candidate backlog.
2. Deduplicate tasks that address the same underlying gap from different angles — keep the most precise formulation.
3. Assign priorities based on: severity of gap (CRITICAL > WARNING), cross-dimension leverage (a task that unblocks multiple dimensions rises), and irreversibility (state that becomes harder to fix later rises).
4. Produce a prioritized backlog of concrete, bounded tasks ready to enter the normal sprint loop.
5. Record the decomposition in `run-journal.md` using this structure:

   ```
   Strategic decomposition: <goal statement>
   Dimensions scanned: <list>
   Aggregate finding: <one sentence per dimension — CRITICAL/WARNING/PASS>
   Priority rationale: <how the final ordering was determined>
   Backlog tasks added: <count and IDs>
   ```

### Transition Back to Tactical Loop

After convergence, the sprint backlog is populated with concrete tasks. The normal Decision Loop resumes from the top. No special mode persists — strategic decomposition is a one-time bootstrap phase triggered by goal type, not a recurring state.

> **Guard**: If the convergence step cannot reduce the candidate backlog to a finite ordered list, the goal scope is too large for one sprint. Partition the goal into sequential milestones and decompose only the first milestone.

---

## Concurrency Contract

Parallel execution is encouraged when tasks are independent.

Rules:

1. Let the manager agent decide concurrency dynamically at runtime.
2. Parallelize where dependency graph allows; serialize where it does not.
3. Use quality gates as synchronization barriers before state promotion.
4. Never bypass acceptance to "speed up" parallel tracks.
5. Record concurrency decisions and tradeoffs in `run-journal.md`.

When planning concurrency, produce a machine-readable plan:

```json
{
  "primaryTaskId": "AP-001",
  "parallelTracks": ["AP-002", "AP-003"],
  "dependencyGraph": {
    "AP-001": [],
    "AP-002": [],
    "AP-003": ["AP-002"]
  },
  "syncPoints": ["quality-gates"]
}
```

Execution path preference:

1. Default: model-native tool orchestration + gate synchronization.
2. Experimental opt-in only (explicit human request): `node scripts/va-parallel-runner.mjs spawn --plan-file ...`.

---

## State Update Contract

Use deterministic updates only:

```bash
node scripts/sprint-board.mjs update --id AP-001 --state "In Progress"
node scripts/sprint-board.mjs journal --task AP-001 --summary "what changed"
```

Rules:

1. Do not hand-edit generated rows in `docs/todo/sprint.md`.
2. Update `.va-auto-pilot/sprint-state.json` through CLI whenever possible.
3. Keep `run-journal.md` append-only.
4. When marking a task `Failed`, record a pitfall entry alongside the state update:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sprint-board.mjs update --id AP-001 --state "Failed" \
     --failure-type <gate|acceptance|review> --attempted "..." --hypothesis "..."
   node scripts/sprint-board.mjs pitfall --task AP-001 \
     --failure-type <gate|acceptance|review> --attempted "..." --hypothesis "..." \
     [--missing-context "..."]
   ```
   The pitfall entry is the durable, queryable record. Resolve it when the failure is fixed:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sprint-board.mjs pitfall --resolve PF-001 --resolution "..."
   ```

---

## Delegation Contract

Every implementation delegation must include:

1. Task ID and objective
2. Relevant file paths
3. Hard constraints (architecture, security, naming, limits)
4. Completion gates (`pnpm run check:all`)
5. A no-how clause: do not prescribe implementation steps
6. If `.va-auto-pilot/pitfalls.json` contains unresolved entries matching the current task by task ID, failure type, or keyword overlap — include them verbatim in the **Hard constraints** section with the heading `Known pitfalls to avoid`.

---

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Build and Static Quality

```bash
pnpm run check:all
```

### Gate 2: Code Review

```bash
codex review --uncommitted
```

Review findings policy:

- `CRITICAL` / `BUG` / `VIOLATION`: must fix and re-review
- style-only nits: optional, non-blocking

### Gate 3: Acceptance

```bash
pnpm run validate:distribution
```

Pass criteria:

- MUST assertions: 100% pass
- SHOULD assertions: >= 80% pass

---

## Multi-Perspective Review

### Design Philosophy

Perspectives are not predetermined roles — they are views from specific constraint intersections that expose distinct failure modes. The right perspectives emerge from identifying real constraints and anchors first. A fixed list of roles is valid only if each role was derived from the constraint and anchor analysis for this task and each exposes failure modes the others miss.

When a review stall occurs, the problem is most often in anchor or perspective selection, not the implementation. See [When Review Cycles Stall](#when-review-cycles-stall) for the bounded procedure governing anchor revision.

### Dynamic Perspective Selection

The model determines which perspectives to apply for each task.

**Step 1: Identify real constraints**

What hard boundaries govern this task? Examples: security invariants, performance budgets, API contracts, backward compatibility, data privacy, state-machine integrity.

**Step 2: Identify anchors**

What must remain true after this change? An anchor is the invariant that cannot be violated. Anchor selection determines whether subsequent analysis converges. A weak or misspecified anchor is the most common cause of false assurance.

> **Guard**: If no clear anchor can be identified after applying the constraint list, stop and request human clarification before beginning review. Do not start a review cycle without a confirmed anchor.

**Step 3: Let perspectives emerge**

Given the constraints and anchors, ask: which expert views would expose the most critical failure modes? Perspectives must be specific to this task, not generic role labels. Each must probe failure modes the others miss.

**Perspective count heuristic**: Start with 2. Add one perspective for each: external API surface affected, security boundary crossed, persistent state modified, multiple components touched. Cap at 5.

Examples — table entries are category-level sketches; instantiate each with task-specific framing in the actual review prompt (e.g., not "Threat modeler" but "Threat modeler focused on the new token refresh endpoint's exposure to replay attacks"):

| Change type | Possible perspectives |
|-------------|----------------------|
| CLI tool update | Correctness auditor, API consumer, Operator (failure modes) |
| Auth/security change | Threat modeler, Compliance reviewer, Regression auditor |
| Data pipeline | Data integrity auditor, Privacy/compliance, SRE |
| UX feature | Accessibility engineer, Performance auditor, Product consistency |
| Protocol/spec change | Adopter (downstream impact), Implementer (ambiguity), Adversarial reader |

**Step 4: Anchor-grounded review prompt**

Every review prompt must explicitly state:

1. What changed and why (the git diff scope and design rationale)
2. The hard constraints that apply
3. The anchor — the invariant that must hold
4. The reviewer's specific perspective and the concrete failure modes they are probing

### Review Completion Condition

Review is complete when all of the following are true:
- All selected perspectives have been applied
- No `CRITICAL`, `BUG`, or `ANCHOR VIOLATION` findings remain open
- Every `WARNING` / `RISK` finding has a recorded disposition (fixed or explicitly accepted with rationale)

**Iteration cap**: If `CRITICAL` findings persist after 3 complete review cycles (each cycle = all perspectives re-applied), stop and escalate to human.

### Finding Policy

- `CRITICAL` / `BUG` / `ANCHOR VIOLATION`: must fix, then re-run the full perspective set before proceeding
- `WARNING` / `RISK`: record and decide — fix or document accepted risk
- Style / preference: non-blocking

### When Review Cycles Stall

If the review completion condition is met but the model cannot confirm it with confidence:

1. Re-examine the anchor — it may be too weak or misspecified
2. Re-examine the constraint set — a missing constraint is the most common source of false assurance
3. Add a perspective that directly challenges the anchor
4. If the completion condition still cannot be confirmed after three re-anchoring attempts, treat remaining uncertainty as irreducible and escalate to human

---

## Sprint Completion Gate

Before declaring any sprint Done, an independent adversarial review must run. This gate exists to prevent self-validation bias: the sprint team, having implemented the changes, is structurally blind to certain failure modes. A fresh-context adversarial reviewer closes that gap.

### Reviewer Setup

Launch a new sub-agent with no prior context about what was done this sprint. The reviewer receives only:

1. The git diff of the sprint (all changes since the sprint started)
2. The current state of every file that was modified

The reviewer must not be told what the sprint intended to accomplish. The diff is the only evidence.

### Perspective Assignment

The manager must assign a specific adversarial perspective based on what the sprint actually changed — not a generic "code reviewer". The perspective is derived by examining the diff and asking: who would be most damaged by a latent flaw here, and what would they be watching for?

Examples:
- Sprint added a new CLI command → perspective: "a developer who will automate this command in a CI pipeline and has been burned by silent failures before"
- Sprint modified auth or token handling → perspective: "a security engineer doing a post-incident review after a credentials leak"
- Sprint changed a public-facing protocol or spec → perspective: "an adopter who built a tool on top of this protocol and just had a dependency break without warning"
- Sprint updated documentation or guidelines → perspective: "a new team member following these instructions on their first day, with no existing context to fill gaps"

The perspective must name a real stake the reviewer has in the output. "Adversarial reviewer" is not a valid perspective — it is a structural role. The perspective specifies the viewpoint from which the reviewer attacks.

### Reviewer Mandate

The adversarial reviewer must:

1. Read the diff and changed files with the assigned perspective held in mind
2. Assume the sprint team was competent but blind to something specific — find what
3. Return a structured finding report:

   ```
   Perspective: <specific assigned perspective>
   CRITICAL findings:
     - <finding> — <why it matters from this perspective> — <what must change>
   WARNING findings:
     - <finding> — <risk> — <recommended action>
   PASS:
     - <what was checked and found sound>
   ```

### Gate Enforcement

- **CRITICAL findings block sprint completion.** They re-enter the task loop as new `Backlog` tasks tagged with the sprint ID, and the sprint state remains `In Progress` until resolved.
- **WARNING findings** must have a recorded disposition: fixed, or explicitly accepted with rationale written into `run-journal.md`.
- **PASS with no CRITICAL or unresolved WARNING** = gate clears. Sprint may advance to Done.

> **Guard**: The adversarial reviewer must be a genuinely fresh context — it must not have access to the sprint team's reasoning, intent statements, or prior chat. If the review is being run by the same agent that implemented the sprint, the agent must reason exclusively from the diff and changed files, deliberately suppressing implementation knowledge. Flag in `run-journal.md` when this condition is met imperfectly. **When flagged, treat all PASS findings from that review as WARNING pending a genuinely fresh-context review** — the flag is not a disclosure, it is a control downgrade.

---

## Commit Policy

Commit immediately after required gates pass.

Rules:

1. One completed task = one commit (parallel tracks commit independently after gates)
2. Stage only task-related files
3. Commit message describes intent
4. Never force push unless explicitly approved
5. Never commit secrets

---

## Stop Conditions

Stop and wait for human when:

1. Backlog is empty
2. Same task failed three times
3. External resources are required
4. High-impact architecture decision is needed
5. Destructive operation is required

Record stop reason in `sprint-state.json` and `run-journal.md`.
