## Done
| ID | Task | Completed | Verification |
|----|------|-----------|--------------|
| AP-001 | Upgrade multi-perspective review to dynamic perspective selection | 2026-02-23 | Two cross-reviews (adversarial + protocol designer), 6 CRITICALs resolved, templates synced |
| AP-003 | Add sprint-board.mjs add command to create tasks via CLI without hand-editing JSON | 2026-02-23 | add command implemented: auto-ID (AP-NNN), validation, depends-on, regex-safe prefix; printHelp updated; templates mirrored; all gates pass |
| AP-004 | Add unit test suite for sprint-board.mjs pure functions | 2026-02-23 | 41/41 unit tests pass via node:test; check:units added to check:all; all gates pass |
| AP-006 | Expand test-flows to cover add, update, journal, and next CLI commands | 2026-02-23 | sprint-board-cli.yaml added (9 flows, 18 MUST/3 SHOULD); test-cli-flows.mjs runner with isolated_state/isolated_journal; check:cli-flows added to check:all; all gates pass |
| AP-009 | Add Strategic Decomposition phase to protocol for high-level goals | 2026-02-23 | Strategic Decomposition section added to both protocol files. Specifies strategic vs tactical detection, parallel dimension-scan with independence constraint, structured audit report format, convergence step with run-journal schema, and transition back to tactical loop. Concurrency follows existing Concurrency Contract. Guards are bounded. npm run check:all and npm run validate:distribution pass. |
| AP-010 | Add mandatory post-sprint independent adversarial review phase to protocol | 2026-02-23 | Sprint Completion Gate section added to both protocol files. Specifies adversarial reviewer setup (fresh context, diff-only), manager-assigned specific perspective grounded in what changed, structured finding report format, CRITICAL-blocks / WARNING-requires-disposition enforcement, and guard with control-downgrade semantics (not just disclosure) when fresh context is unavailable. npm run check:all and npm run validate:distribution pass. |
| AP-011 | Add retrospective failure log: capture structured failure metadata and pitfall guide | 2026-02-23 | pitfall CLI (add/resolve/list), failureDetail on update --state Failed, templates/.va-auto-pilot/pitfalls.json, protocol updated (Operational Memory, State Update, Delegation contracts), pitfall count in summary, 9 new CLI flow tests pass, all 41 unit tests pass, validate:distribution passes |
| AP-002 | Fix parseArgv boolean flag regression (--flag value silently dropped) | 2026-02-23 | parseArgv now throws when bool flag is followed by non-flag token; templates mirrored; check:all and validate:distribution pass |
| AP-005 | Replace hand-rolled YAML parser with yaml package in sprint-utils.mjs | 2026-02-23 | yaml package moved to dependencies; readSprintPathsFromConfig replaced with yaml.parse(); stripYamlValue kept as compat export; templates mirrored; all gates pass |
| AP-008 | Resolve templates/ dual-copy maintenance burden | 2026-02-23 | All gates passed: 41/41 unit tests, 18/18 CLI flow MUSTs, validate:distribution. Init smoke test confirmed scripts/ correctly copied to target project. Dry-run path verified. Mirror drift check removed. templates/scripts/ deleted. |
| AP-007 | Correct 'human-out-of-the-loop' framing to 'human-on-the-loop' across docs and website | 2026-02-23 | docs/human-on-the-loop.md created with updated framing; old file removed; README.md and README.zh.md references updated; all gates pass |
