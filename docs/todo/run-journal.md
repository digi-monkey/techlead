- Summary: synchronized 1 parallel track(s) before quality gates.
- Primary Task: AP-001
- Tracks: AP-001:TIMEOUT
- Files:
  - `/Users/vadaski/vadaski/Code/auto-pilot/.va-auto-pilot/parallel-runs/AP-001.log`
- Note: exit-0 moves task to Review; manager agent must still run multi-perspective review and acceptance gates.

## 2026-02-23T18:28:25.081Z - AP-001
- Summary: Upgraded Multi-Perspective Review section in va-auto-pilot-protocol.md. Two independent AI cross-reviews (adversarial adopter, protocol designer) each found 3 CRITICALs — all 6 resolved: anchor identification guard added, confidence replaced with concrete completion condition, 3-cycle iteration cap added, bounded stall procedure, perspective count heuristic, re-review = full set. Template synced. validate-distribution passed.
- Files: `docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md`, `templates/docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md`, `docs/todo/human-board.md`
- Signals:
  - multi-perspective review must use anchor+constraint grounding before selecting perspectives
  - completion condition must be concrete and checkable not vague confidence
  - all review loops must have bounded iteration caps
---

## 2026-02-23T18:54:44.849Z - AP-002
- Summary: Fixed parseArgv boolean flag regression: bool flag followed by non-flag token now throws instead of silently dropping the value. e.g. --json false now gives a clear error. Mirrored to templates/scripts/lib/sprint-utils.mjs. All gates passed.
- Files: `scripts/lib/sprint-utils.mjs`, `templates/scripts/lib/sprint-utils.mjs`
- Signals:
  - parseArgv boolean flag guard: reject non-flag token after bool flag with explicit error
  - never allow silent value drops in arg parsers
---

## 2026-02-23T18:54:53.575Z - AP-003
- Summary: Added sprint-board.mjs add command: auto-assigns next sequential ID (AP-NNN), requires --title and --priority, supports --source and --depends-on. nextTaskId() escapes regex special chars in projectPrefix to prevent injection. printHelp updated. Both scripts/sprint-board.mjs and templates/scripts/sprint-board.mjs updated identically. All gates passed.
- Files: `scripts/sprint-board.mjs`, `templates/scripts/sprint-board.mjs`
- Signals:
  - sprint-board add command: use normalizeTask for all new tasks to ensure schema consistency
  - escape regex metacharacters when building dynamic RegExp from user-supplied strings
  - always mirror scripts/ changes to templates/ counterpart

## 2026-02-23T19:10:47.479Z - AP-004
- Summary: Added 41-test unit suite (node:test) covering all pure functions in sprint-utils.mjs and sprint-board.mjs CLI surface. Added check:units to package.json and check:all pipeline. Tests use isolated tmp dirs; no real state files touched.
- Files: `scripts/test-units.mjs`, `package.json`
- Signals:
  - node:test is available in Node>=20 with no extra deps; use spawnSync for CLI-level tests; always use writeTmpState() for isolated state in unit tests
---

## 2026-02-23T19:10:53.790Z - AP-005
- Summary: Replaced hand-rolled YAML line parser in readSprintPathsFromConfig with yaml.parse(). Moved yaml from devDependencies to dependencies (it is a runtime import). stripYamlValue kept as exported compat utility. Templates mirrored. All 41 unit tests still pass.
- Files: `scripts/lib/sprint-utils.mjs`, `templates/scripts/lib/sprint-utils.mjs`, `package.json`
- Signals:
  - yaml package must be in dependencies not devDependencies when used in runtime scripts; keep stripYamlValue as compat export when removing internal use
---

## 2026-02-23T19:11:01.495Z - AP-006
- Summary: Added test-flows/sprint-board-cli.yaml (9 CLI flows covering add, update, journal, next, summary, --help, error cases) and scripts/test-cli-flows.mjs runner. Flows with isolated_state/isolated_journal get tmp copies of real files to prevent state pollution. check:cli-flows added to check:all.
- Files: `test-flows/sprint-board-cli.yaml`, `scripts/test-cli-flows.mjs`, `package.json`
- Signals:
  - CLI flow tests must use isolated_state to avoid polluting real sprint state; test-cli-flows.mjs skips chat-based flows (session:/turns:) transparently; cwd must be repo root
---

## 2026-02-23T19:11:07.411Z - AP-007
- Summary: Renamed docs/human-out-of-the-loop.md to docs/human-on-the-loop.md. Updated title and all occurrences of backtick-quoted term inside doc. Updated README.md and README.zh.md references. Old file deleted.
- Files: `docs/human-on-the-loop.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh.md`
- Signals:
  - human-on-the-loop is the correct framing: human supervises the loop but does not step into it; the old term implied human removal which is wrong
---

## 2026-02-23T19:23:55.804Z - AP-008
- Summary: Eliminated templates/scripts/ dual-copy. bin/va-auto-pilot.mjs init now copies scripts verbatim from the package's own scripts/ directory (single source of truth). validate-distribution.mjs mirror equality section removed; requiredFiles list pruned to remove templates/scripts/* entries. 41/41 unit tests, 18/18 CLI flow MUSTs, validate:distribution all pass. Init smoke test confirmed correct script output. Dry-run path verified. Multi-perspective review (Correctness Auditor + CLI Consumer): no critical findings.
- Files: `bin/va-auto-pilot.mjs`, `scripts/validate-distribution.mjs`, `templates/scripts/ (deleted)`

## 2026-02-23T19:31:44.940Z - AP-009
- Summary: Added Strategic Decomposition section to docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md and templates/docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md. Section activates on strategic (vague, multi-axis) goals. Key design decisions: dimensions emerge from goal analysis, not fixed lists — consistent with the constraint/anchor/perspective model; dimension-scan concurrency defers to the existing Concurrency Contract (model-native by default, experimental runner requires human opt-in); convergence produces a run-journal entry with defined schema; guard bounds the case where goal scope exceeds one sprint. Adversarial review (Sprint 4 post-sprint gate) surfaced one WARNING: concurrency section tension — fixed by adding explicit deference to Concurrency Contract and serialization fallback; one WARNING: unstructured journal entry — fixed by adding schema; one WARNING: honor-system guard — fixed in AP-010. All gates pass.
---

## 2026-02-23T19:31:54.606Z - AP-010
- Summary: Added Sprint Completion Gate section to docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md and templates/docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md. Section runs before any sprint is declared Done. Key design decisions: reviewer receives only the git diff and changed file state — no intent context; manager must assign a specific perspective derived from what changed (examples show stake-based framing, not role labels); CRITICAL findings block completion and re-enter task loop; WARNING requires recorded disposition. Critical design fix from adversarial review (Sprint 4 post-sprint gate): the guard was a disclosure, not a control. Fixed: when fresh-context condition is flagged imperfect, all PASS findings are downgraded to WARNING pending genuine fresh-context review. This makes the imperfection consequential rather than cosmetic. Self-referential note: this sprint's adversarial review was run by the implementing agent (imperfect fresh-context). Per the new guard, PASS findings from that review are treated as WARNING. Flagged in this journal entry. All gates pass.

## 2026-02-23T19:41:32.839Z - AP-011
- Summary: Added retrospective failure log (pitfalls.json) and pitfall guide CLI to sprint-board.mjs. Structured failureDetail on update --state Failed. pitfall command: add/resolve/list with isolated_pitfalls test support. Pitfall count surfaced in sprint-board summary. Protocol updated: Operational Memory Contract (read pitfalls.json each cycle), State Update Contract (record pitfall on Failed), Delegation Contract (inject pitfalls into Hard constraints). Sprint Completion Gate adversarial review (reliability engineer / write-only log perspective) found 3 WARNINGs: two fixed (summary pitfall count, list summary line), one accepted (fuzzy keyword overlap in protocol is intentional flexibility).
- Files: `scripts/sprint-board.mjs`, `scripts/test-cli-flows.mjs`, `scripts/validate-distribution.mjs`, `docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md`, `templates/docs/operations/va-auto-pilot-protocol.md`, `templates/.va-auto-pilot/pitfalls.json`, `test-flows/pitfall-cli.yaml`
- Signals:
  - pitfall command uses --pitfalls-file for test isolation
  - readPitfalls falls back to empty state if file missing
  - failureDetail only written when at least one structured field is provided
  - --list --json returns raw entries array
